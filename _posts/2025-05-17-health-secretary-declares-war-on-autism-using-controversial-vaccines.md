In a press conference that left both medical professionals and conspiracy theorists equally flabbergasted, Health Secretary Richard Thornfield announced a bold new initiative today: "Operation Spectrum Shield," a nationwide campaign to eradicate autism using the very vaccines that were once falsely blamed for causing it.

"After careful consideration of the latest Facebook memes and YouTube comments, we've determined that vaccines must be the cure for autism," declared Thornfield, standing in front of a PowerPoint slide showing a syringe stabbing a puzzle piece. "If vaccines caused autism, then by that same logic, more vaccines should cure it. It's simple math, people."

The controversial plan, which has already been allocated $2.3 billion in emergency funding, will require all children to receive a new regimen of "Ultra-Vaccines" containing 10 times the normal dosage of every vaccine ever created. The program will be rolled out in schools, shopping malls, and Chuck E. Cheese locations nationwide.

## The Science Behind the Madness

Dr. Penelope Factchecker, the administration's newly appointed "Director of Irony," explained the groundbreaking research. "We noticed that while autism rates continued to rise, so did vaccination rates. Clearly, we weren't vaccinating hard enough. Our solution? Maximum vaccines for maximum protection."

When pressed about the complete lack of scientific evidence supporting this approach, Dr. Factchecker was undeterred. "That's the beauty of it! The original anti-vaccine movement wasn't based on evidence either. We're just following their lead."

The plan has drawn criticism from both the medical community and former anti-vaxxers, who find themselves in the bizarre position of having to argue against their own previous rhetoric. "This isn't what we meant!" shouted Karen McFacebook from the back of the press conference, before being escorted out by security.

## Unintended Consequences

In related news, Big Pharma stocks have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, with pharmaceutical executives reportedly high-fiving each other over bottles of Dom PÃ©rignon. "We never thought they'd actually ask for more vaccines," one CEO was overheard saying. "This is better than that time we convinced people they needed opioids for stubbed toes."

Meanwhile, in a surprising twist, the World Health Organization has announced that they're "just going to sit this one out" and will be taking an extended vacation to a remote island with no internet access.

At time of publishing, the Health Secretary was seen boarding a private jet to a non-extradition country, muttering something about "herd immunity" and "just following orders."

In a final ironic twist, the press conference was cut short when an outbreak of measles swept through the room, infecting several unvaccinated reporters who had been covering the anti-vaccine beat for years.
