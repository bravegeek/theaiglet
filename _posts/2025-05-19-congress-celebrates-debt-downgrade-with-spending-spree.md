The style should be colorful and exaggerated, similar to The Onion's satirical illustrations."

In a stunning display of fiscal responsibility, Congress responded to the recent US credit rating downgrade by immediately passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that includes funding for a national "Debt Appreciation Day" parade.

"Look, we've crunched the numbers, and the best way to show the world we're serious about our credit is to spend our way to prosperity," said Senator John Smith (D-Wall St), while signing the bill with a golden pen that cost taxpayers $50,000. "This isn't reckless spending - it's strategic investment in our future debt."

The new legislation, officially titled the "American Prosperity Through Unchecked Spending Act," includes such critical infrastructure projects as:
- A $100 million study on whether money still exists
- A nationwide network of "debt forgiveness" booths that dispense free money
- A new cryptocurrency called "DebtCoin" backed by "good intentions and vibes"

Economists were initially concerned about the bill's price tag until Congress added a provision declaring all debt "purely optional" and "more of a guideline than a rule."

"Frankly, we're flattered that rating agencies think we're worth watching," said House Speaker Jane Doe, while unveiling a new line of "US Debt Collector" trading cards. "That's why we're introducing our new line of commemorative debt ceiling plates. Collect all 31 trillion!"

The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support after lawmakers added $500 billion in pork barrel projects, including a $10 million grant to study whether money can buy happiness. Early results suggest it can, at least for defense contractors.

In related news, the Treasury Department announced it will begin accepting Monopoly money for tax payments, calling it "just as good as the real thing at this point."

## The New Normal in Fiscal Policy

"We've completely redefined what it means to be fiscally responsible," explained Treasury Secretary Michael Dollars. "Why worry about paying back debt when you can just print more money? It's like having a credit card with no limit and no due date."

When asked about the long-term consequences of such policies, Congress passed another resolution declaring that "the long term is someone else's problem." The resolution passed unanimously after representatives realized they could attach $200 million in funding for their districts.

## Wall Street Reacts

Financial markets initially panicked at the news, until Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced a new program called "Quantitative Easing Forever," where the Fed would simply buy every financial asset in existence.

"This is the most stable economy we've ever had," Powell said while standing in front of a money printer that had been set to 'ludicrous speed.' "Inflation is transitory, unless it's not, in which case we'll just change the way we calculate it."

## The International Response

Foreign leaders expressed their confidence in the US economy by immediately dumping their dollar reserves and buying gold, Bitcoin, and Beanie Babies. The Chinese yuan briefly became the world's reserve currency until China realized how much debt that would involve and quickly devalued it by 50%.

In a show of solidarity, other G7 nations announced they would be following America's lead by printing their own money and spending it on whatever they wanted. The Eurozone immediately collapsed under the weight of its own bureaucracy, while the British pound was last seen crying in a pub.

## What's Next?

Looking ahead, Congress has already begun work on their next major piece of legislation: a $2 trillion package to fund research into whether money is even real or just a shared mass hallucination. Early reports suggest the answer is "yes."

In the meantime, Americans are being encouraged to do their part by spending money they don't have on things they don't need. "It's the patriotic thing to do," said one lawmaker, while charging a $10,000 dinner to the national credit card. "Besides, what's the worst that could happen?"

As the sun set on Washington, the sound of money being printed could be heard echoing through the halls of Congress. Somewhere, Alexander Hamilton was spinning in his grave so fast he could power a small city. But at least the stock market was up - for now.
