VATICAN CITY - In what can only be described as divinely inconvenient timing, the Vatican is reportedly in a state of holy panic as they prepare for the upcoming visit of the U.S. Vice President, coming just weeks after the Pope's sudden and mysterious death following his last visit to Washington.

The late Pontiff, who had been in excellent health according to Vatican spokespeople (except for that one persistent cough and the mysterious rash that kept getting worse), passed away shortly after returning from a private meeting with the Vice President. Vatican officials insist the timing is purely coincidental, though they've reportedly hired extra food tasters and are considering having the Vice President eat first at all meals.

"Of course we're not suggesting anything untoward happened," said Cardinal Giuseppe Belladonna, nervously eyeing the Swiss Guards and adjusting his bulletproof vest. "It's just that, statistically speaking, it would be quite the coincidence if the Vice President were to visit and then, well, you know... popes have been known to be quite old, after all."

The Vatican has taken unprecedented security measures, including blessing all cutlery, replacing the traditional holy water with regular water ("just to be safe"), and installing new smoke detectors in the Sistine Chapel that can detect more than just burning ballots.

The Vice President's office has released a statement saying they're "looking forward to a productive visit" and that the Vice President is "excited to pay respects to the late Pope and meet with the new Holy Father, whoever that may be by then." They've also requested a tour of the Vatican's "less cursed" artifacts.

Meanwhile, the College of Cardinals is reportedly considering emergency protocols, including preemptively selecting the next three popes and keeping them in a secure, undisclosed location until after the visit.

When reached for comment, a White House spokesperson simply said, "No comment," before quickly adding, "I mean, come on, that's ridiculous. Why would we... I mean, seriously?" before hanging up.

## Holy Security Measures

Sources inside the Vatican report that security has been tightened to unprecedented levels:

* All Swiss Guards issued with new halberds that are definitely not just for show this time
* Confessionals equipped with lie detectors and panic buttons
* Emergency "pope in a box" contingency plan activated
* All visitors required to sign a waiver that includes a "no spontaneous combustion" clause

## Divine Diplomacy

Diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the United States remain "strained but cordial," according to insiders. The Vatican has reportedly requested that the Vice President limit her entourage to "no more than 200 people, and please leave the black SUVs at home this time."

In a show of goodwill, the White House has agreed to provide its own food tasters, though the Vatican has politely declined the offer of a presidential food taster to taste the food tasters.

## The Last Supper 2.0

Plans for the traditional diplomatic dinner are still being finalized, with the Vatican suggesting a simple meal of bread and fish (thoroughly tested for poison), while the Vice President's team has requested a full seven-course meal with wine pairings (to be tested by at least three people per course).

"We're confident this visit will go off without a hitch," said a Vatican spokesperson, knocking on wood, crossing themselves, and throwing salt over their shoulder simultaneously. "After all, what are the odds of two popes dying under mysterious circumstances after meeting with the same U.S. official?"

When reminded that the number would be one, not two, the spokesperson excused themselves to go check on the emergency supply of communion wafers, which are reportedly being stored in a lead-lined safe just in case.
