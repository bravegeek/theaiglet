The rider has an ecstatic expression, with luxurious hair flowing dramatically in the wind. The scene is lit with golden hour lighting, and the motorcycle is a classic American model. The style should be photorealistic with a slight satirical edge, reminiscent of political cartoons but with high production value. The image should convey both freedom and absurdity."

In a historic move that has both thrilled hair care professionals and baffled safety experts, President Donald Trump today signed an executive order eliminating all helmet-related regulations across federal agencies, declaring it a victory for personal freedom and fabulous hairstyles everywhere.

"The American people have been oppressed by the tyranny of helmet laws for far too long," the President announced from the Rose Garden, his own meticulously coiffed hair defying gravity with what experts believe is an entire can of extra-hold hairspray. "From this day forward, no government bureaucrat will stand between you and your God-given right to perfect hair."

The sweeping order immediately nullifies helmet requirements from OSHA, DOT, NHTSA, and even extends to sports leagues, construction sites, and military operations. "If a soldier wants to storm the beaches of Normandy with their hair flowing like a Pantene commercial, that's their constitutional right," the President added, adjusting his own signature hairstyle in the reflection of a nearby window.

## Safety Concerns Brushed Aside

Safety advocates were quick to express concerns about the potential consequences. "This is literally going to kill people," said Dr. Sarah Chen, head of the National Safety Council, before being drowned out by a group of hair stylists cheering and waving bottles of hair product.

The Department of Transportation released a statement saying they would comply with the order but suggested that "all Americans consider the benefits of not having their skulls cracked open like eggs on the pavement." The statement was immediately walked back after the President threatened to replace the entire department with a single bottle of extra-strength mousse.

## The Economic Impact

Wall Street responded enthusiastically to the news, with shares in hair care companies soaring to record highs. "We haven't seen numbers like this since the Great Hairspray Shortage of 2023," said financial analyst Mark Henderson. Meanwhile, helmet manufacturers saw their stocks plummet faster than a motorcyclist without head protection in a high-speed collision.

Beauty salons across the nation reported being booked solid for weeks as Americans rushed to get their hair styled for what many are calling the "Golden Age of Unprotected Scalps." The President's personal hairstylist was seen being carried through the streets on the shoulders of cheering salon owners.

## A New Era of Freedom

As the President signed the order using a pen made from 100% recycled hair extensions, he took a moment to reflect on his campaign promise. "They said 'Mr. President, you can't just eliminate all helmet laws,' and I said, 'Watch me' while dramatically flipping my hair. And now here we are."

When asked about the potential increase in head injuries, the President simply replied, "Hair today, gone tomorrow. That's the price of freedom." He then mounted a motorcycle without a helmet and rode off into the sunset, his hair flowing majestically in the wind.
