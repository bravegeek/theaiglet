### Tone & Voice

✅ **DO:**
- Use professional news writing tone
- Maintain deadpan delivery

❌ **DON'T:**

- Be mean-spirited or punch down
- Use excessive exclamation points
- Make it obvious it's satire through tone alone

### Satirical Techniques

1. **Absurdist Escalation** - Start with something almost believable, then gradually increase the ridiculousness
2. **Ironic Juxtaposition** - Pair serious professional language with absurd content
3. **Deadpan Quotes** - Have characters say outrageous things in a matter-of-fact way
4. **Specific Details** - Use precise (fake) numbers, names, and facts to add believability
5. **Bureaucratic Language** - Use official-sounding names for ridiculous initiatives
6. **Mock Expertise** - Include "expert" opinions that validate the absurdity

### Targets & Themes

**Punch Up, Not Down:**
- Target power structures, politicians, corporations

### Character Names

Create memorable but believable character names:

**Good Examples:**
- Chester B. Fogarty (sounds like a real politician)

- Dr. Evelyn Winters (credible expert)

**Avoid:**
- Too obvious puns (e.g., "Senator Corrupt McBadguy")
- Real people's names
- Names that break immersion

### Fictional Entities

Create believable-sounding organizations, companies, and initiatives:

**Good Examples:**
- "Freedom to Fume Act"
- "Efficiency Over Etiquette" initiative

## Common Patterns

### Quote Integration

- Use realistic-sounding corporate/political jargon

### Ending Styles

2. **The Escalation** - Introduce one final absurd detail
