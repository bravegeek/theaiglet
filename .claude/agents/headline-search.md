- Exaggerate the absurd elements
- Point out corporate doublespeak or political spin
- Suggest Onion-style satirical takes

**Examples:**
- Real headline: "Tech CEO announces return-to-office mandate"
  - Satirical angle: "CEO who spent pandemic on yacht insists employees need 'company culture' found only in fluorescent-lit cubicles"

- Real headline: "New AI chatbot passes medical licensing exam"
  - Satirical angle: "AI doctor recommends turning it off and on again for heart attack patients"
