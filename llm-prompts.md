# LLM Prompts for Story Generation Workflow

## Prompt 1: Branch and Prompt Selection
```
Check out the gh-pages branch of the repository and read the prompt.md file. Identify the next unchecked prompt in the file and display it to me.
```

## Prompt 2: Story Generation
```
Using the following prompt: "[INSERT SELECTED PROMPT HERE]", generate a creative short story. Format the story according to the structure defined in template-article.md, including appropriate front matter.
```

## Prompt 3: Story Publishing
```
Save the generated story to the _posts directory with the filename format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md, where YYYY-MM-DD is today's date and title is a kebab-case version of the story title. Then commit this new file with a descriptive message like "Add new story: [STORY TITLE]".
```

## Prompt 4: Prompt Management
```
In the prompt.md file, mark the prompt "[INSERT USED PROMPT HERE]" as checked by adding an 'x' in its checkbox. Commit the updated prompt.md with a message indicating "Mark prompt as used: [BRIEF PROMPT DESCRIPTION]". Then push all changes to the remote repository.
```

## Prompt 5: Clean Up
```
Check out the main branch to complete the workflow.
