&amp;ldquo;After extensive research—and by research, I mean reading a few Facebook posts from both sides—we&amp;rsquo;ve determined that vaccines are the perfect weapon in our war against autism,&amp;rdquo; declared Wainwright, standing in front of a banner that read &amp;ldquo;Mission: Possible - Autism Free by 2030.</description></item></channel></rss>
