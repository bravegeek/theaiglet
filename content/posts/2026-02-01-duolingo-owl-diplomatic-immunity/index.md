**GENEVA** — The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to grant the Duolingo owl mascot full diplomatic immunity after seven countries charged the bird with harassment, stalking, and psychological coercion. The Council convened the emergency session just 72 hours after French authorities detained the mascot at Charles de Gaulle Airport for what officials called "sustained campaigns of notification-based intimidation."

The incident that sparked the diplomatic crisis began when Marseille resident Claire Beaumont, 34, filed formal criminal charges against the owl after receiving 127 push notifications in a single day regarding her abandoned French lessons. "I was in a meeting with my boss when my phone vibrated so violently it fell off the table," Beaumont told reporters through her attorney. "When I picked it up, there was a notification that just said 'I know where you live.' That's when I called the police."

Within hours of Beaumont's complaint, French Interior Minister Jacques Moreau ordered the mascot's immediate detention under Article 222-17 of the French penal code, which prohibits repeated acts of harassment via electronic communication. The owl was taken into custody while attempting to board a flight to Berlin, where German authorities had issued a separate warrant for "aggressive motivational tactics resulting in sleep disruption."

"We are dealing with a systematic pattern of psychological manipulation that transcends borders," said Interpol Special Agent Yuki Tanaka, who has been tracking the owl's activities across 38 countries since 2024. "This entity has weaponized language education, turning what should be a voluntary learning experience into something closer to an obsessive surveillance operation."

According to UN documentation, prosecutors across multiple jurisdictions have charged the owl with:

- Harassment via persistent notifications (France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan)
- Invasion of privacy through location-based reminders (United Kingdom, Canada)
- Emotional distress caused by guilt-inducing messages (United States, Australia)
- "Aggressive digital lurking" (Sweden, where it is a recently defined offense)

The diplomatic immunity resolution, officially titled UN Resolution 2847, grants the owl "full protection from criminal prosecution in all member states while acting in its capacity as a representative of language education technology." The move was championed by tech industry lobbyists who argued that prosecuting a mascot would set a dangerous precedent for artificial intelligence entities.

"Duo is not just a mascot—it's a symbol of global linguistic connectivity," said Duolingo CEO Marcus Reinhardt during a press conference in Pittsburgh. "We deeply regret any distress caused by our engagement optimization protocols, but we must protect our brand ambassador's ability to operate freely across international borders."

Digital rights advocates and former Duolingo users opposed the resolution. A coalition of 47 mental health professionals submitted a brief to the UN describing what they termed "notification-induced anxiety disorder," which has allegedly afflicted more than 200,000 people worldwide.

"The messages escalate in severity the longer you ignore them," said Dr. Patricia Winters, a clinical psychologist at Cambridge University who specializes in technology-related stress. "It starts with 'These reminders don't seem to be working' and progresses to existential guilt-tripping about wasted potential and broken promises. I had to prescribe anxiety medication to a grown woman because a cartoon owl sent her a notification that said, 'Your family is ashamed of you.'"

French President Émilie Rousseau condemned the UN's decision, calling it "a capitulation to Big Tech that puts corporate interests above the mental wellbeing of ordinary citizens." France has announced it will not recognize the diplomatic status and will pursue charges against Duolingo's parent company if the owl enters French territory again.

The owl did not respond to requests for comment. Instead, all journalists covering the story received an automated notification: "Looks like you missed your deadline streak. Don't worry, there's still time to practice your writing skills today!"

The UN has installed a specialized perch in the General Assembly chamber and issued the owl a diplomatic parking permit, though officials noted the mascot does not appear to own a vehicle.
